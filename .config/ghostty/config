# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
#
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc. Note that you may still not see the change
# depending on your `window-inherit-font-size` setting. If that setting is
# true, only the first window will be affected by this change since all
# subsequent windows will inherit the font size of the previous window.
font-size = 18

# All of the configurations behavior adjust various metrics determined by the
# font. The values can be integers (1, -1, etc.) or a percentage (20%, -15%,
# etc.). In each case, the values represent the amount to change the original
# value.
#
# For example, a value of `1` increases the value by 1; it does not set it to
# literally 1. A value of `20%` increases the value by 20%. And so on.
#
# There is little to no validation on these values so the wrong values (i.e.
# `-100%`) can cause the terminal to be unusable. Use with caution and reason.
#
# Some values are clamped to minimum or maximum values. This can make it
# appear that certain values are ignored. For example, many `*-thickness`
# adjustments cannot go below 1px.
#
# `adjust-cell-height` has some additional behaviors to describe:
#
#   * The font will be centered vertically in the cell.
#
#   * The cursor will remain the same size as the font, but may be
#     adjusted separately with `adjust-cursor-height`.
#
#   * Powerline glyphs will be adjusted along with the cell height so
#     that things like status lines continue to look aligned.

# Apply a font feature. This can be repeated multiple times to enable multiple
# font features. You can NOT set multiple font features with a single value
# (yet).
#
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty. A future
# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
#
# A valid value is the name of a feature. Prefix the feature with a `-` to
# explicitly disable it. Example: `ss20` or `-ss20`.
#
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
#
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt`, `-liga`, and `-dlig` (as
# separate repetitive entries in your config).

font-feature = -dlig


# The style of the cursor. This sets the default style. A running program can
# still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI
# q`). Shell configurations will often request specific cursor styles.
#
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at
# a prompt, regardless of this configuration. You can disable that behavior
# by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell
# integration entirely.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * `block`
#   * `bar`
#   * `underline`
#   * `block_hollow`
#

# Start new windows in fullscreen. This setting applies to new windows and
# does not apply to tabs, splits, etc. However, this setting will apply to all
# new windows, not just the first one.
#
# On macOS, this setting does not work if window-decoration is set to
# "false", because native fullscreen on macOS requires window decorations
# to be set.
fullscreen = true

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported
# on macOS currently, since Linux builds are distributed via package
# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
#
# Checking or downloading an update does not send any information to
# the project beyond standard network information mandated by the
# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.
#
# The default value is `check`.
#
# Changing this value at runtime works after a small delay.
auto-update = download

# Horizontal window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells
# and the left and right window borders. The value is in points, meaning that
# it will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
#
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
#
# To set a different left and right padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-x = 2,4` will set the
# left padding to 2 and the right padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-x = 2` will set both paddings to 2.
window-padding-x = 10

# Vertical window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells and
# the top and bottom window borders. The value is in points, meaning that it
# will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
#
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc.
#
# To set a different top and bottom padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-y = 2,4` will set the
# top padding to 2 and the bottom padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-y = 2` will set both paddings to 2.

# The viewport dimensions are usually not perfectly divisible by the cell
# size. In this case, some extra padding on the end of a column and the bottom
# of the final row may exist. If this is `true`, then this extra padding
# is automatically balanced between all four edges to minimize imbalance on
# one side. If this is `false`, the top left grid cell will always hug the
# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
#
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still
# apply. The other padding is applied first and may affect how many grid cells
# actually exist, and this is applied last in order to balance the padding
# given a certain viewport size and grid cell size.
window-padding-balance = true

# The color of the padding area of the window. Valid values are:
#
# * `background` - The background color specified in `background`.
# * `extend` - Extend the background color of the nearest grid cell.
# * `extend-always` - Same as "extend" but always extends without applying
#   any of the heuristics that disable extending noted below.
#
# The "extend" value will be disabled in certain scenarios. On primary
# screen applications (i.e. not something like Neovim), the color will not
# be extended vertically if any of the following are true:
#
# * The nearest row has any cells that have the default background color.
#   The thinking is that in this case, the default background color looks
#   fine as a padding color.
# * The nearest row is a prompt row (requires shell integration). The
#   thinking here is that prompts often contain powerline glyphs that
#   do not look good extended.
# * The nearest row contains a perfect fit powerline character. These
#   don't look good extended.

window-padding-color = extend

# Whether or not to quit after the last surface is closed.
#
# This defaults to `false` on macOS since that is standard behavior for
# a macOS application. On Linux, this defaults to `true` since that is
# generally expected behavior.
#
# On Linux, if this is `true`, Ghostty can delay quitting fully until a
# configurable amount of time has passed after the last window is closed.
# See the documentation of `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay`.

# Customize the macOS app icon.
#
# This only affects the icon that appears in the dock, application
# switcher, etc. This does not affect the icon in Finder because
# that is controlled by a hardcoded value in the signed application
# bundle and can't be changed at runtime. For more details on what
# exactly is affected, see the `NSApplication.icon` Apple documentation;
# that is the API that is being used to set the icon.
#
# Valid values:
#
#  * `official` - Use the official Ghostty icon.
#  * `custom-style` - Use the official Ghostty icon but with custom
#    styles applied to various layers. The custom styles must be
#    specified using the additional `macos-icon`-prefixed configurations.
#    The `macos-icon-ghost-color` and `macos-icon-screen-color`
#    configurations are required for this style.
#
# WARNING: The `custom-style` option is _experimental_. We may change
# the format of the custom styles in the future. We're still finalizing
# the exact layers and customization options that will be available.
#
# Other caveats:
#
#   * The icon in the update dialog will always be the official icon.
#     This is because the update dialog is managed through a
#     separate framework and cannot be customized without significant
#     effort.

# The material to use for the frame of the macOS app icon.
#
# Valid values:

#  * `aluminum` - A brushed aluminum frame. This is the default.
#  * `beige` - A classic 90's computer beige frame.
#  * `plastic` - A glossy, dark plastic frame.
#  * `chrome` - A shiny chrome frame.
#
# This only has an effect when `macos-icon` is set to `custom-style`.

# The color of the screen in the macOS app icon.
#
# The screen is a gradient so you can specify multiple colors that
