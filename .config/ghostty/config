# My Ghostty config. You can get a list of available options by running the
# following:
#
# ```bash
# ghostty +show-config --default --docs
# ```
#
# See also: https://ghostty.org/docs/config

# Background color for the window. Matches the color of my nvim theme
# using loupe tool :P
background = "#14161b"

# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
#
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
#
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
#
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
#
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.

# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
#
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc. Note that you may still not see the change
# depending on your `window-inherit-font-size` setting. If that setting is
# true, only the first window will be affected by this change since all
# subsequent windows will inherit the font size of the previous window.
font-size = 18

# All of the configurations behavior adjust various metrics determined by the
# font. The values can be integers (1, -1, etc.) or a percentage (20%, -15%,
# etc.). In each case, the values represent the amount to change the original
# value.
#
# For example, a value of `1` increases the value by 1; it does not set it to
# literally 1. A value of `20%` increases the value by 20%. And so on.
#
# There is little to no validation on these values so the wrong values (i.e.
# `-100%`) can cause the terminal to be unusable. Use with caution and reason.
#
# Some values are clamped to minimum or maximum values. This can make it
# appear that certain values are ignored. For example, many `*-thickness`
# adjustments cannot go below 1px.
#
# `adjust-cell-height` has some additional behaviors to describe:
#
#   * The font will be centered vertically in the cell.
#
#   * The cursor will remain the same size as the font, but may be
#     adjusted separately with `adjust-cursor-height`.
#
#   * Powerline glyphs will be adjusted along with the cell height so
#     that things like status lines continue to look aligned.

# Apply a font feature. This can be repeated multiple times to enable multiple
# font features. You can NOT set multiple font features with a single value

# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
#
# A valid value is the name of a feature. Prefix the feature with a `-` to
# explicitly disable it. Example: `ss20` or `-ss20`.
#
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
#
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt`, `-liga`, and `-dlig` (as
# separate repetitive entries in your config).

# The style of the cursor. This sets the default style. A running program can
# still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI

#
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at
# a prompt, regardless of this configuration. You can disable that behavior
# by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell
# integration entirely.

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported
# on macOS currently, since Linux builds are distributed via package
# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
#

# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.

#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
#
# To set a different left and right padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-x = 2,4` will set the
# left padding to 2 and the right padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,

# The viewport dimensions are usually not perfectly divisible by the cell
# size. In this case, some extra padding on the end of a column and the bottom
# of the final row may exist. If this is `true`, then this extra padding
# is automatically balanced between all four edges to minimize imbalance on
# one side. If this is `false`, the top left grid cell will always hug the
# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
#
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still
# apply. The other padding is applied first and may affect how many grid cells
# actually exist, and this is applied last in order to balance the padding
# given a certain viewport size and grid cell size.

#   any of the heuristics that disable extending noted below.
#
# The "extend" value will be disabled in certain scenarios. On primary
# screen applications (i.e. not something like Neovim), the color will not
# be extended vertically if any of the following are true:
#
# * The nearest row has any cells that have the default background color.
#   The thinking is that in this case, the default background color looks
#   fine as a padding color.
# * The nearest row is a prompt row (requires shell integration). The
#   thinking here is that prompts often contain powerline glyphs that
#   do not look good extended.
# * The nearest row contains a perfect fit powerline character. These
#   don't look good extended.

# Customize the macOS app icon.
#
# This only affects the icon that appears in the dock, application
# switcher, etc. This does not affect the icon in Finder because
# that is controlled by a hardcoded value in the signed application
# bundle and can't be changed at runtime. For more details on what
# exactly is affected, see the `NSApplication.icon` Apple documentation;
# that is the API that is being used to set the icon.
#
# Valid values:
#
#  * `official` - Use the official Ghostty icon.
#  * `custom-style` - Use the official Ghostty icon but with custom
#    styles applied to various layers. The custom styles must be
#    specified using the additional `macos-icon`-prefixed configurations.
#    The `macos-icon-ghost-color` and `macos-icon-screen-color`
#    configurations are required for this style.
#
# WARNING: The `custom-style` option is _experimental_. We may change
# the format of the custom styles in the future. We're still finalizing
# the exact layers and customization options that will be available.
#
# Other caveats:
#
#   * The icon in the update dialog will always be the official icon.
#     This is because the update dialog is managed through a
#     separate framework and cannot be customized without significant
#     effort.

# Shell integration features to enable. These require our shell integration to
# be loaded, either automatically via shell-integration or manually.
#
# The format of this is a list of features to enable separated by commas. If
# you prefix a feature with `no-` then it is disabled. If you omit a feature,
# its default value is used, so you must explicitly disable features you don't
# want. You can also use `true` or `false` to turn all features on or off.
#
# Example: `cursor`, `no-cursor`, `sudo`, `no-sudo`, `title`, `no-title`
#
# Available features:
#  - `cursor` - Set the cursor to a blinking bar at the prompt.
#  - `sudo` - Set sudo wrapper to preserve terminfo.
#  - `title` - Set the window title via shell integration.
#  - `ssh-env` - Enable SSH environment variable compatibility. Automatically
#     converts `TERM` from `xterm-ghostty` to `xterm-256color` when connecting
#     to remote hosts and propagates `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM`, and
#     `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`. Whether or not these variables will be accepted
#     by the remote host(s) will depend on whether or not the variables are
#     allowed in their sshd_config. (Available since: 1.2.0)
#  - `ssh-terminfo` - Enable automatic terminfo installation on remote hosts.
#     Attempts to install Ghostty's terminfo entry using `infocmp` and `tic`
#     when connecting to hosts that lack it. Requires `infocmp` to be available
#     locally and `tic` to be available on remote hosts. Once terminfo is
#     installed on a remote host, it will be automatically "cached" to avoid
#     repeat installations. If desired, the `+ssh-cache` CLI action can be used
#     to manage the installation cache manually using various arguments.
#     (Available since: 1.2.0)
#
# SSH features work independently and can be combined for optimal experience:
# when both `ssh-env` and `ssh-terminfo` are enabled, Ghostty will install its
# terminfo on remote hosts and use `xterm-ghostty` as TERM, falling back to
# `xterm-256color` with environment variables if terminfo installation fails.
